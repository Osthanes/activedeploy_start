DEPLOYMENT_METHOD_DESC=Specify how apps or container groups are scaled during the ramp-up phase. Possible values are: <br/> <b>Red Black:</b> Apps or container groups are scaled at 2*n instances. Since the original version and the new version run all instances at the same time. Rollback is faster when using this method. <br/> <b>Resource Optimized:</b> Apps or container groups are scaled at n+1 instances. When an instance of the new version is started, an instance of the original version is removed. Resources consumption is lower when using this method.

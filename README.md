# activedeploy_start

An [IBM® Bluemix® DevOps Services Build & Deploy](https://hub.jazz.net/docs/deploy/) pipeline extension used to begin an active deploy for Cloud Foundry applications and IBM Containers.

A pipeline job created from this extension must be used in the same stage with a job to deploy a single unrouted instance of the successor app and a job to complete the active deploy.

For more details, see [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ActiveDeploy/updatingapps.html#adpipeline).
